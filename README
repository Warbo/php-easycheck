= EasyCheck =

A basic property-checking framework, in the spirit of QuickCheck.

EasyCheck defines three functions:

 - `deftest(string $description, callable $test)` for defining a test
 - `deftests([$description => $test])` for defining multiple tests
 - `runtests(null)` for running all tests

== Tests ==

Tests can be any callable and can take any number of arguments; EasyCheck will
count the required argument number and supply that many random numbers.

Tests can indicate a pass by returning falsy values (false, null, 0, [], '').
To indicate a failure, return a truthy value; this will usually be an error
message or some debugging information.

== Usage ==

Internally, tests are kept in an array and keyed by their descriptions, which
can be any unique string.

`runtests(null)` will execute all tests, returning an array of truthy results
(ie. the failures).

== Examples ==

    deftest('All ints are > or <=', function($x, $y) {
                                      $gt  = $x >  $y;
                                      $lte = $x <= $y;
                                      return ($gt || $lte)? 0
                                                          : get_defined_vars();
                                    });
